Grappl is a tool for getting hosting servers behind closed ports.
Other people on the internet don't have to download anything to connect.

It works by transferring data through a proxy on grappl.io.

It's still pretty early alpha. This repository contains all the newest client code, and some of the server and web code.

This project uses the library [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson). Remember to set it up on your IDE.
