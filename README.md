Grappl is a tool for getting hosting servers behind closed ports.
Other people on the internet don't have to download anything to connect.

It works by transferring data through a proxy on grappl.daexsys.com.

It's still pretty early alpha, and very in-development. This repository contains all the code
even remotely related to the project (including the website!) so work needs to be done to cut
down on the repo's scope a little. :P
