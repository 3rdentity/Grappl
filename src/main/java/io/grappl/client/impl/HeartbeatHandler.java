/**
 * Creates and tracks connections to relay heartbeat servers.
 *
 * In ye olde days, it was only expected that one instance of the application
 * would only generate one Grappl connection, so it made sense to have the heartbeat
 * connections in the TCPGrappl class. However, now that the application is capable
 * of creating multiple tunnels, it's a total waste to have every single TCPGrappl
 * object handling it's own heartbeats, since you technically only need one per relay.
 *
 * This is where this class comes it. When a Grappl is opened, it checks to see if a heartbeat
 * is already created to the relay it is attempting to connect to. If it already is, nothing
 * more is done. Otherwise, a new one is opened, and recorded.
